            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Web Developer</p>
            <p>I am a full-time student and teaching assistant at Iowa State University.
                Some of the most useful courses I've taken include
                Data Structures and Algorithms, Advanced Programming Techniques, Construction of User Interfaces, and
                Embedded Systems.
                I also spend a good chunk of my time as part of the teaching assistant team for Digital Logic.

                <h3>BACK-UPS</h3>
                <p>This project was made by 3 others and myself in an effort to learn game design. Throughout the process, we learned how to make a game's physics, database, and more within Godot Game Engine. I was also solely responsible for making all 3D designs and learned how to use Blender.</p>

                <h3>Family Travel Tracker</h3>
                <p>This side project was something I made while learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a PostgreSQL database to keep track of user data and allows the user to switch between family member tabs and add to a list of countries they've visited. The database tracks a different list of countries for each person.</p>
